# Automated Intrusion Detection

This project evaluates password strength and credential security by testing
three password policies and analyzing metrics like strength, cracking time, and computational cost.

**Password Policies Tested:**
1. **Basic Policy:** Minimum 8 characters, with at least 1 uppercase letter, 1 number, and 1 special character.
2. **10-Character Policy:** Minimum 10 characters, with at least 1 uppercase letter, 1 number, and 1 special character.
3. **Custom Policy:** Avoids personal information and common sequences.

## Features

- Tests different hashing techniques:
  - MD5
  - SHA-256
  - Salted SHA-256 with hashing time comparison

## Instructions to Run

1. Clone the repository.
2. Install the requirements.
3. Run the main script.
